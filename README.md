# 🎵 Music Popularity Prediction with Python

This project aims to predict the popularity of music tracks based on their audio features using machine learning techniques. Built on Spotify data, the model helps understand what makes a track more likely to be popular by analyzing patterns in various musical attributes.

## 🚀 Features

- Utilizes **Spotify audio features** like `energy`, `valence`, `danceability`, `tempo`, `acousticness`, and more.
- Conducts detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and relationships.
- Implements **feature selection** to improve model performance and reduce noise.
- Trains a **Random Forest Regression model** achieving **85%+ accuracy** in popularity prediction.
- Improves baseline performance by **25%** through iterative tuning and visual error analysis.
